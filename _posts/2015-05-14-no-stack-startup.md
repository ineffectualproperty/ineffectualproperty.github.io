No-Stack Startups + Specialization:
This merges a bit with the concept of a “no-stack” startup.
http://blog.aweissman.com/2015/05/no-stack-startups.html

The idea here is that emerging small businesses are starting to focus more on their core competency, and outsource the rest of their work to various platforms (Facebook/Instagram/Pintrest for marketing/front-end, Stripe for credit card processing, Shippo for postal shipping, etc.). I think the break-up of eBay and PayPal points further in this direction with platforms focusing more and more on a specific niche (eBay on marketplaces, and PayPal on payment processing). 

This gets me thinking about the concept for Distio that I pitched and won Startup Weekend for last year. At the time I was focused on solving a particular use case, how can these new small businesses get cheap and easy distribution for their products. This was a real problem with the people I talked to at the farmer’s market who were starting to expand their business. 

““I do marketing, sales, social media, accounting, tech support, and I spend one day a week doing deliveries.  If I could economically outsource delivery and be sure that my product was on the shelf, I would.” - Matt Choi, Choi’s Kimchi

At the time I was focused on building more of a ‘full-stack’ startup, with a both a retail marketplace, and a distribution marketplace, where distributors could bid on delivery jobs that came out of the retail marketplace. As I looked at the ecosystem, one of the things that made me the most hesitant was the ease with which incumbents in this market could enter (e.g. Uber). In fact, we are already see Uber addressing the B2C delivery market with Uber essentials: http://blog.uber.com/essentials. The other issue were around dealing with a three-sided market place (buyers/receivers, distributors, sellers/senders) and the regulation around distributor on-boarding/vetting.

Another startup has slimmed down this concept with Roadie: http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/27/roadie-launches-as-the-uber-for-shipping-and-delivery/, by connecting only shippers and distributors. However, they are still performing two functions, on boarding/vetting drivers and providing a marketplace for shipper/distributor interaction.
